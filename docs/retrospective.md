# Project Retrospective

## Sprint 1 

*Started: 11th February*

*Finished: Sunday 24th February*

### Things to Improve

- specifying the requirements prior to the sprint
- recording who had been assigned to each task
- potentially ought to have scraped the entire weather API, rather than just timestamp, weather and temperature.
